# This is the global configuration file for prompttest.
# Settings and reusable components here are available to ALL test suites.
# For larger projects, you can add a `prompttest.yml` in subdirectories
# for more localized, shared components.

# A note on free models from OpenRouter:
# Using models marked with ":free" is a great way to test without cost.
# However, be aware that your prompts and completions may be used by the
# model provider to train future models. For sensitive data, consider
# using a paid model instead.

config:
  # Model used to generate the response from your prompt.
  generation_model: "z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free"

  # Model used to evaluate if the response meets the criteria.
  evaluation_model: "mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct:free"

reusable:
  inputs:
    # A single, reusable value.
    product_name: &product_name "Chrono-Watch"
    # A group of reusable values.
    standard_user: &standard_user
      user_name: "Alex"
      user_tier: "Premium"
  criteria:
    # A multi-line, reusable value.
    is_polite: &is_polite >
      The response must be polite, friendly, and helpful. It should adopt
      an empathetic tone, especially if the user seems frustrated or angry.
